But more important than that, (to) the commuters who were injured in this accidents I want to give my full wishes for a final and speedy recovery,” said Millar Crawford, Thales’ executive vice-president for ground transportation systems, on Tuesday (21 November).All but one of the passengers have since been discharged from hospital, with one remaining under observation for neck and back pains.The accident took place when a software glitch unexpectedly disabled a safety feature on the train that was hit as it passed a trackside device at Clementi. The train, which stopped to detrain passengers at Joo Koon station, was later hit by another train behind it as the latter had misread the size of the first train due to the disabling of the aforementioned feature.Train services between the Joo Koon and Gul Circle stations were suspended as of Monday amid further checks on the new signalling system that is currently in place along the Tuas West Extension.\n",
      "Crawford, who was speaking at a joint SMRT-Land Transport Authority (LTA) press conference on Tuesday, added that Thales is fully cooperating with the other latter organisations in a “deep and meaningful” examination of the event and is taking on “full responsibility” for its part in the accident.\n",

      "Millar Crawford, executive vice-president for ground transportation systems at Thales, apologised on Tuesday (21 November) to commuters who had been affected or injured in the Joo Koon train collision.\n",
      "Thales is the French conglomerate supplying the new signalling system that has been put in place along the North-South Line and parts of the East-West Line. Crawford was speaking to the media following a joint SMRT-Land Transport Authority press conference on the Joo Koon incident.\n",
      "Last Wednesday, LTA deputy chief executive officer Chua Chong Kheng had suggested that Thales would bear the blame for the signalling issues that led to the collision.“We are looking to Thales in terms of the solution, and also to convince SMRT and (LTA) that the system is safe… We will work as a team but, primarily, the responsibility for the signalling safety is with the supplier,” said Chua.Keeping things separateAccording to Crawford, the “unexpected condition” which led to the Joo Koon collision was a result of the interface between the legacy signalling system and the new Communication-Based Train Control (CBTC) system that Thales is working to implement along the East-West Line (EWL).Currently, the EWL operates on the older signalling system between Pasir Ris and Joo Koon stations, while the Tuas West Extension (TWE) – running from Gul Circle to Tuas Link – runs on the new CBTC system.As of 16 November, the signalling system of the TWE has been “completely separated” from that of the EWL in order to reduce complications from operatiing two different signalling systems concurrently on an extended line, said LTA chief executive Ngien Hoon Ping.“This separation will continue until the EWL re-signalling works are completed next year. No trains with passengers will move between these two segments,” he said. This means that commuters travelling westwards through Joo Koon station will need to take a bridging bus service between Joo Koon and Gul Circle stations before continuing on their train journey.\n",

      "French signalling system supplier 'could have done better': Khaw Boon Wan on Joo Koon collision\n",
      "Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan speaking during a doorstop interview at the SMRT headquarters on Tuesday (21 November).\n",
      "He had attended a joint SMRT-Land Transport Authority press briefing on the train collision at Joo Koon MRT station on 15 November.\n",
      "Speaking at a doorstop interview after the press conference, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan said the separation was a “good decision” that would help ensure a “clean system” until the re-signalling works are completed.“When we launched Tuas West Extension, we intended for it to be a seamless service. All the way from Pasir Ris to Tuas Link. On hindsight of course this introduced a lot of complications, because you have two stretches, each running on different signalling systems,” he said, adding that this also created a “challenging situation” for Thales.“But still, Thales could have done better. They have acknowledged their mistake, they have apologised,” said Khaw.Asked if the government would be seeking any compensation from Thales, Khaw said there could be some “contractual obligations” but would leave the matter in the LTA’s hands.“Inevitably, (public) confidence will be shattered by events like this. What happened, happened so we just have to get it over with and regain the public’s confidence, which means it’s back to same old job: we have to raise reliability.“As I told Singaporeans before, this is a multi-year effort. I gave myself four years, we are halfway through. If it weren’t for this incident, as well as the flooding incident, we were actually making good progress… but the re-signalling does add complications to all this,” said the minister.Related stories:Software glitch in signalling system led to Joo Koon train collision38 injured as SMRT trains collide at Joo Koon MRT Station ReblogShareTweetShareView reactions (106)Sign in to post a message.What to read nextReduced service hours at 19 MRT stations in December to help speed up re-signalling worksYahoo News SingaporeDiscover the Southern Charm of USA in HoustonSingapore AirlinesSponsored'Lightning strike' near Bedok MRT, train captain warded at CGHYahoo News SingaporeNo MRT service between Joo Koon and Gul Circle stationsYahoo News SingaporeJoo Koon train collision: Could train driver have stopped in 10 seconds?Yahoo News SingaporeThese Jaw Dropping Products A Must Buy For 2017Smarter HorizonSponsoredMan who broke into woman's home, raped her gets 21 years' jail, 18 strokesYahoo News SingaporeEx-officials accused of corruption in Manila train contractAssociated PressWOWtv - Jeffrey Tambor is Leaving 'Transparent'WOWtvCelebrate a Snowy ChristmasDisneylandSponsoredPHOTOS: Joo Koon MRT Station after train collisionTrial begins for ex-coach accused of sexually abusing teenage girlYahoo News SingaporePHOTOS: CID officers learn from US forensic expert to examine 'shooting incident'Learn How Christy Ng Shoes Conquered the GlobeFedExSponsoredAthens traffic snarled as subway workers hold 24-hour strikeAssociated PressWOWtv - Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth are Building a NurseryWOWtv\n"
